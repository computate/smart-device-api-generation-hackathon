## Problem Statement: Describe the specific problem or challenge you aimed to address during the hackathon using AI tools/technologies.

Because reactive/asynchronous APIs are more efficient and scalable, but are much more complex to build by hand. 
We can use code generation to build extendable APIs consistently, faster, and more secure with AI/ML Code Generation based on the well established [computate open source project](https://github.com/computate-org/computate). 
Increase Quarkus API and web developer productivity with OpenAPI Code Generation based on code comments. 
Deploy new edge device models and edge device models following open source FIWARE smart data model schemas with AI/ML predictive code generation.
